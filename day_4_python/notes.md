I really liked the CodeDex site! Although the tutorials are a bit too simple for me, I enjoyed the virtual pet/diary feature and the community projects. I'd love to make my own Python virtual pet one day, but for now, I’m starting small as I learn new things.

I made a simple script that creates a little executable program with a macOS icon, allowing me to open my pet's log directly from my desktop. This way, I’ll have a quick visual reminder and (hopefully) won’t forget to log a day!

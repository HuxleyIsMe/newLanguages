 then it is to pass in a replica
 In JS I'd probably end up passing in the real thing then spreading it i.e. {...} to make myself a copy.

    reading this strtok looks the best, but begs the question is this like an npm module? Whats the package manager sit?:finalString

    Chats got this one :D
    Great question â€” C++ doesn't have a direct equivalent to npm, but there are a few popular package managers and build systems that together cover similar territory.

    Hereâ€™s the breakdown:

        ðŸ”§ Closest equivalents to npm in C++:
        Tool	Description	Like npm in that it...
        vcpkg	Microsoft-backed package manager	Installs and manages C++ libraries with a simple CLI
        Conan	Dependency manager focused on C++	Handles versioning, builds, and dependencies
        CMake	Build system generator	Kind of like package.json + npm run build but lower-level
        Make / Ninja	Actual build runners	Execute compiled instructions â€” like npm scripts but lower-level

    ðŸª› TL;DR:
    Thereâ€™s no single, universal npm for C++, but:

    vcpkg and Conan are your closest friends

    Youâ€™ll almost always see CMake in the mix to glue things together

    Would you like a minimal starter C++ project using vcpkg and CMake to play with?

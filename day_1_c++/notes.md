### Notes on learning C++

Welcome to a land of C++, I don't know what I am doing here but lovely Codedex.io has hatched me a Hippo, and im not gonna let my bebe hippo
down! ( https://www.codedex.io/@huxlux/)

In honesty I'd like to learn C++ because its useful for writing speedy script that control hardware. I'd like to be able to write scripts for robotic - I have slowly been learning more about circuits and building - i'd like to build more hardware, especially if i can add lights and make it go 'boop'.

I have previously dabbled with C when i made then coded a mini car that only drives forward... it did however have lights so like urgh winning - things got a little more advanced when i worked on a kit called "Lost in space" which was epically fun and i really enjoyed >> https://academy.craftingtable.com/lostinspace?srsltid=AfmBOoqeYHLLyVhv1RuCPeCm09tCc50EhRjOcq9ktkf5jsD4UmAO-e24


## Day 1 roughly 2hrs spent...

And its kinda the same.... Syntactically there are mild differences but not that much.

I completed the Codedex course then went through W3 schools offering: 
https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/ 

Also i was lucky enough to stumble on some archived Standford Uni handouts:

https://stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1132/handouts/03-Getting-Started.pdf. Which really just condensed all my notes.

At the moments the biggest difference to me are pointers and references. 

I understand this will become important in terms of memory management. 

Im realizing that i need to have longer to get into meatier projects and understandings.

im gonna start by bobbing of some code kata challenges with C++

Once ive gotten comfortable ill take on a bigger project.

## Reflections

While i enjoyed this dabble, in future i think I will skip most of the tutorials until I find a 'new' concept then invest time. 

Also I really wanted to learn C++ because i wanted experience working with lower level languages, and having to deal with memory management this was not enough time to do this.

### 7 days of 7 different languages

Hello! So I recently heard about the book 7 languages in 7 weeks, so i thought i'd give it a go.

I came across a wonderful site called: https://www.codedex.io/home <<-- like honestly its beautiful and while Codecademy and Udemy will always be my go to's, this site is great! 

### Why?

I want to try 7 different languages in 7 week to get a light feel for each and there differences. I intend to spend at least 3 hrs a day with the language and see how far we get, probably not very, but at the end ill take what i know and dive further!

### who are we choosing:

- Python
- C++
- Ruby ( I have done this before but a long time )
- PHP ( I have done this before but a long time )
- SQL ( I have done this before but a long time )
- Java ( I have done this before but a long time - Android)
- Go ( I have dabbled before recently )
- Rust ( I have dabbled but years a go )
- Swift ( no, i really didn't like XCode :/ but maybe? is there something nicer? )
- React Native (I've dabbled, thinking it would be the same as React it was not, it really was not. )

Ok wow so i have actually dabbled with more then a i thought..... erm what else is out there thats really different

- Haskell mmm i tried this but it was ergh difficult
- Bash hmmm i'd like to get better writing shell script they allways seem to come up and im always left clicking about
- web assembly this sounds really cool like really cool
- scala hm i've heard of scala but yeah i havent used it


Right ok, At the mo im looking for a fun and a lower level language i will commit to:

- c++ - because  i started on codex and it should help with lower level programming
- python - because everyone is using it and i'd like to be able to look at large amounts of data without excel
- Go - because everyone is using it
- bash - ooo i'd like to be able to write simple shell scripts
- scala - whats the hype
- web assembly - yes please lets do it
- rust - i have forgotten everything but id like to remember and then i can make a desktop app with JavasScript!

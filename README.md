### 7 days of different languages

Hello! So I recently heard about the book 7 languages in 7 weeks, so i thought i'd give it a go in a micro level.

### Why?
I want to try 7 different languages in 7 days to get a light feel for each and there differences. I intend to spend at least 3 hrs a day with the language and see how far we get, probably not very, but at the end ill take what i know and dive further!

### Notes on learning C++

Welcome to a land of C++, I dont know what I am doing here but lovely Codedex.io has hatched me a Hippo, and im not gonna let my bebe hippo
down! ( https://www.codedex.io/@huxlux/)

In honesty I'd like to learn C++ because its useful for writing speedy script that control hardware. I'd like to be able to write scripts for robotic - I have slowly been learning more about circuits and building - i'd like to build more hardware, especially if i can add lights and make it go 'boop'.

I have previously dabbled with C when i made then coded a mini car that only drives forward... it did however have lights so like urgh winning
things got a little more advanced when i worked on a kit called saving urself from space which was epically fun and i really enjoyed.


## Day 1 roughly 2hrs spent...

And its kinda the same.... 

Syntactically there are mild differences but not that much.

I completed the Codedex course then went through W3 schools offering:

Also i was lucky enough to stumble on some archived Standford Uni handouts:

https://stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1132/handouts/03-Getting-Started.pdf

Which really just condensed all my notes.

At the moments the biggest difference to me are pointers and references. 

I understand this will become important in terms of memory management. 

Im realizing that i need to have longer to get into meatier projects and understandings.

However ChatGPT has provided me with a challenge, so i will begin that tomorrow but i'd like to look at memory management after

# Markdown

## Er thats not a language...

Yeah markdown isn't a language its a tool that enables us to generate static sites simply and easily. But like thats kinda cool right?

Also how many times am I having to write markdown and just using the basics? A lot. 

This day was kinda me just upping my skills with mark down and having some fun. Things should start looking a lot nicer! 

I also converted my personal site to using markdown rendering allowing me to easily write blogs at my IDE and then publish. Such a nicer experience. 

This led me to discovering a bug in a popular package, that i will raise as a bug tomorrow.
